Developed using Macos, Node.js 16.14.2

node_modules need to be installed before running. ("npm instal")
To test the application, run "node index.js".

It performs all the CRUD activities for the 3 collections, and prints output to 
the console.

I recommened running the application more than once to see different number of
purchases and orders.


My database design is partially normalized, it store the user_id and item_id on each 
order and each purchase as a unique purchase_id.
I also store the name and email of user in the order table.
I did this so query orders and purchases user matching email.


The program works exactly as required. Any issues let me know.
